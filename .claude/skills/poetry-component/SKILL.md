  Author and audit poetry components: the canonical class anatomy
  (section order every component follows), the documentation standard
  (YARD + projected strings), and the audit checklist. Load this
  WHENEVER creating a new component that inherits from
  Poetry::Core::Component, extending an existing component family, or
  reviewing a component file for structure and documentation - the
  anatomy is the contract that keeps every component readable the same
  way.

# poetry-component - the authoring layer

poetry's catalog guarantees valid, accessible components; this skill
covers building one of your own. A component that follows the canonical
anatomy is legible to every reader - human, agent, and the machine
surfaces (registry, contract checks, docs) that project from its
declarations. Load this before writing the class, not after it fails
review.

## Verbs

- **create** (`references/anatomy.md`) - author a new component: the
  section order, what each DSL declares, and a complete skeleton to
  start from.
- **document** (`references/documentation.md`) - the documentation
  standard: the class docblock, YARD on public methods, and how to write
  the projected strings (part descriptions, agent rules) that machines
  consume verbatim.
- **audit** (`references/checklist.md`) - review an existing component
  against the anatomy and the documentation standard; the checklist is
  ordered so violations surface in file order.

## The one rule that spans all three

Declaration order inside a section is meaningful: options, parts, and
slots project into the registry and the agent surface in declaration
order. Move whole sections to match the anatomy; never reorder
declarations within a section unless you intend to change the projected
surface.

## Boundaries

- A new component inherits from `Poetry::Core::Component` (or a
  published family's base) and lives in its own `app/components`
  namespace. Never copy a poetry component's source into the app to
  modify it - subclass it, or compose it in a template.
- An app or engine component names its view helper with `helper :name`
  (a distinctive name; keywords + content block, like every poetry
  helper). That one declaration makes it first-class: the helper is
  defined at boot and on reload, `poetry:check` lints it under that name
  with its own contract, llms.txt and the generated skill list it. Run
  `bin/rails poetry:registry` and commit the file so the MCP server (which
  never boots the app) describes and checks it too; `poetry:verify` fails
  when that file is stale.
- A controller of the app's own that a component wires joins the
  controllers manifest with `bin/rails poetry:stimulus:manifest` (commit
  the file). Then `use_stimulus` validates it by Symbol at class load,
  `poetry:check` validates its wiring in templates, and the registry
  carries its API. Write the controller with literal statics (`static
  targets = [...]`, `static values = {...}`, `static events = [...]` for
  the events it dispatches); a parent that is another app controller or a
  poetry controller is merged, a library parent (or a computed static) is
  skipped and named - add that entry by hand in the same file; regeneration
  keeps it. Generate the manifest before declaring the controller by
  Symbol; a controller that dispatches events without `static events`
  leaves its events unvalidated, never wrong.
- A dictionary of your own uses names of your own: prefix its `cn-*`
  classes with the kit (`cn-acme-pill`), never a name a Poetry dictionary
  emits, so the override audit reads your rules as yours and a future
  theme name cannot collide with them. Reusing a theme class as a base is
  fine; writing CSS against it is an override and must be declared.
- Inner classes that exist only to serve a family (item builders,
  internal wrappers) declare `internal_component!` so the registry and
  every surface derived from it skip them.
- Behavior belongs to Stimulus controllers declared through
  `use_stimulus`; a component never ships inline `<script>`.
- Agent tools: declare what an in-page agent may do to a rendered instance
  with `tool :name, description:, params:, executes:, mutating:` beside
  `use_stimulus` (`executes:` names a declared Stimulus action - validated at
  class load); a call opts in with `webmcp: "name"`. See `references/anatomy.md`.
